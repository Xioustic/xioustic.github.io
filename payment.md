## Cash
Cash is accepted in-person only; please do not remit payment of cash via mail.

## Check / Money Order
Please make checks or money orders out to "Christian Ferrier". Send to PO Box 90273, Phoenix, AZ 85066.

## Paypal
The following link can be used to send PayPal payment: [https://paypal.me/xioustic](https://paypal.me/xioustic)

## Cryptocurrency
As Coinbase has discontinued their merchant services and as I wait for Coinbase Commerce to allow me to accept payments, Cryptocurrency payments must be done manually. Please e-mail me at [xioustic@pm.me](mailto:xioustic@pm.me) and I will reply with a payment address that will be signed in accordance with my [Keybase](https://xioustic.com/keybase.txt) or the GPG key on my business card.

## Confirm
Utilizing any payment option, you should also send an e-mail to [xioustic@pm.me](mailto:xioustic@pm.me) to confirm receipt and credit applied to your account. Please specifically mention:

- The entity for whom the payment was for
- The date the payment was made
- The amount of dollars paid
- Any transaction ID if applicable
