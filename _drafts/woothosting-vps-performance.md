Just quickly dumping a benchmark for my $36/yr BOGO WootHosting VPS, purchased on the deal from LowEndBox [here](https://lowendbox.com/blog/woothosting-bogo-2gb-openvz-vps-for-36yr-and-more/).

I used the hostbench.io benchmark script located [here](https://github.com/Lomand/hostbench.sh). Portions of their site and functionality are broken, but the benchmark seems to run fine regardless.
